# Crowdfunding_ETL
This repo contains the files to Project 2 by Team 3

In this project, we practiced building an ETL pipeline to process crowdfunding data from Excel files. We extracted and transformed the data, created four CSV files, and then used the CSV files to create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and a table schema. In the end we loaded the CSV files into a PostgreSQL database.

For the consolidated notebook, please go to ETL_Mini_Project_ESaliaj_ATabatchouk_CBenjamin_ZWu.ipynb

For ERD and SQL schema, please refer to crowdfunding.png and crowdfunding_db_schema.sql
